‚ö° No setup ‚Äì Open Civitas, make a new namespace, start coding.

‚úçÔ∏è Write as you code ‚Äì Capture notes, results, and ideas as you go.

üöÄ Easy to share ‚Äì Create a PR, and it gets published.

üß† Build shared knowledge ‚Äì Your work becomes part of a growing community resource.

üß™ Use Clay ‚Äì Same REPL workflow, but with tables, charts, markdown, and hiccup.

### Write notebooks

Add a notebook in the [`/notebooks`](notebooks) folder.

See the [Clay Documentation](https://scicloj.github.io/clay) for information on how to interactively visualize the
notebook as you write it.
Author profile can be configured in [clay.edn](clay.edn).

### Build the database

Add to or modify [db.edn](quarto/db.edn)

### Preview the full website

```sh
clojure -M:clay -a [:markdown]
```

```sh
quarto preview site
```

### Publish

Merged pull requests are shown on the website via a workflow.


## Design

Align with Clojure's values: simplicity, community, and tooling that helps you think.

### Notebook Namespace Selection

A notebook‚Äôs namespace serves as a clear, unique path to its content and follows **Clojure‚Äôs naming conventions**.

The namespace should emphasize **what the notebook is about**, not how it is categorized.
Think of it as a logical path that leads to a specific artifact or topic.
Classification elements such as tags, author, document type, level, or publication date belong in **metadata**, not the
namespace.

- **Start with an organization** if the notebook is about a library or tool maintained by one.  
  Examples: `scicloj`, `lambdaisland`.
- **Follow with the specific library or concept.**  
  Examples: `scicloj.clay`, `lambdaisland.kaocha`.
- If there is **no organization**, start directly with the library or tool name.  
  Examples: `hiccup`, `reagent`.
  If the notebook refers to an alternative implementation, **include the organization** to disambiguate.  
  Example: `lambdaisland.hiccup`.
- For **core Clojure topics**, use `clojure` as the root.  
  Examples: `clojure.lazy-sequences`, `clojure.transducers`.
- Add **segments** to describe the notebook‚Äôs content. These segments should:
    - Avoid name collisions.
    - Not duplicate metadata.
    - The last segment should be specific and descriptive. Prefer: `z-combinator-gambit`, avoid: `z-combinator`.
- **Events, communities, or topics** may also be used as the top-level namespace when appropriate.  
  Use discretion to determine whether a notebook is primarily about an artifact library,
  a concept, or an event.
- Namespaces must consist of more than one segment.

#### Metadata and Navigation

It may feel unintuitive not to group related content (e.g. an author‚Äôs blog series) by directory or namespace.
But this structure is intentional.
Linear sequences (e.g. blog posts by an author) will be **reconstructed from metadata**, not filenames or folders.
For example, a page showing all blog posts by an author is generated by filtering for `author`, `type = post`, and
`date`, and then ordering by date.

Namespaces prioritize **logical addressing** over ontological hierarchy.
This promotes flexibility at the cost of tidiness, but enables richer discovery through metadata and search.

Differentiation between posts, pages, and presentations is by `type` metadata (a Quarto page type convention).

### File system organization

| Directory                      | Description                                                          |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `src`                          | Code for building a website and database                             |
| `notebooks`                    | Source root for notebooks (Clojure and Markdown), images, data files |
| `site`                         | Static assets of the Quarto website                                  |

Non-Clojure files in `notebooks` will be synced to `site`.
Shared images can go in `images`, but prefer placing images and data files as siblings to your namespace under `notebooks`.
All Clojure and Non-Clojure files in `notebooks` should go under a subdirectory,
so that it is clear they are not part of the static configuration of `site`.
When building the site, Clojure namespaces are built to markdown files under `site/{my/namespaced/notebook.qmd}`.
Subdirectories of `site` are gitignored and considered temporary build artifacts, safe to clean up.
Quarto builds all the markdown into HTML in `_site` for preview and deploy.
While developing, Clay uses `temp` to build and serve HTML files.

Goal: Align with Clojure‚Äôs code organization while allowing organic, practical growth.

### Topic organization

Follow the Quarto convention of categories, tags, and keywords.
Fixed categories; `community`, `algorithms`, `data`, `systems`, `libs`, `concepts`.
Tags; flexible, open-ended for finer-grained labeling (e.g. `frontend`, `reagent`).
Keywords; for SEO or search indexing; typically fewer and focused on discoverability.

Tags and metadata are the preferred organization principle:
[Categories, Links, and Tags](https://gwern.net/doc/philosophy/ontology/2005-04-shirky-ontologyisoverratedcategorieslinksandtags.html)

Goal: Constellations, not cabinets.

### Dependency management

A single `deps.edn` file is shared across all notebooks.

Pros:

* Simplifies website builds.
* Works for authoring as well as building.

Cons:

* Version conflicts must be manually resolved.
* Only one version per dependency.
* Notebooks aren‚Äôt self-contained.

Future:

* Support additional directories under `standalone` with their own `deps.edn`.
* Regression testing would help when versions update.

Goal: Minimize friction in authoring while ensuring publishable reproducibility.
