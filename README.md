Think. Code. Share.

‚ö° No setup ‚Äì Clone this repo, make a new namespace, start coding.

‚úçÔ∏è Write as you code ‚Äì Capture notes, results, and ideas as you go as comments.

üöÄ Easy to share ‚Äì Create a Pull Request, once merged it appears on the [Clojure Civitas Website](https://clojurecivitas.github.io).

üß† Build shared knowledge ‚Äì Your work becomes part of a community resource.

üß™ Visualize ‚Äì Your normal REPL workflow, but with tables, charts, markdown, and hiccup.

## Rationale

*Exploramus, Communicamus, Crescimus*<br>
<small>We explore, we share, we grow.</small>

See [About Clojure Civitas](https://clojurecivitas.github.io/about).

Why markdown in code? We value reproducible artifacts.

## Contributing

Your perspective matters.
Pull Requests invited, that's the point!

### Creating Posts and Pages

Add a Clojure namespace or markdown file in the [`/src`](src) folder.

Add metadata on your namespace to set the title, author, and tags.

```clojure
^{:kindly/hide-code true     ; don't render this code to the HTML document
  :clay             {:title  "About Civitas Metadata"
                     :quarto {:author   :my-unique-id
                              :draft    true           ; remove to publish
                              :type     :post
                              :date     "2025-06-05"
                              :category :clojure
                              :tags     [:metadata :civitas]}}}
(ns my.namespace.example)
```

Configure your author profile in [clay.edn](clay.edn).

Images can be added to the same folder as the namespace,
and displayed with markdown like `;; ![caption](my-image.jpg)`.
The first image on the page is used as a preview in the blog listing,
unless a different image is listed in the metadata.

[Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly-noted/kindly) annotations are rendered as visualizations.

```clojure
^kind/table
{:tables      ["clean layout" "easy to scan" "communicates clearly"]
 :charts      ["information-dense" "reveals insights" "pattern-focused"]
 :hiccup      ["build anything" "custom layouts" "unlimited flexibility"]
 :many-others ["see the examples" "creative uses" "visual variety"]}
```

## Preview the Website **(Optional)**

[Use Clay REPL commands](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/#setup) to visualize the namespace as you write.

Building is delegated to Clay and Quarto.

When using Clay interactively it renders directly to HTML for speed.
The published site goes through a longer process of producing markdown then HTML.

```sh
clojure -M:clay -a [:markdown]
```

```sh
quarto preview site
```

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is the markdown publishing tool.

### Publish

Create a pull request:

1. fork the repository
2. make changes in a new branch and commit them
3. push the branch to your fork
4. open a pull request

Your pull request will be reviewed to prevent abuse and then merged.
Once merged, namespaces are automatically published to the website.

Please contact [@timothypratley](https://github.com/timothypratley) if you are having any difficulty submitting a PR.

### Check Your Page Views

Publicly available [page view analytics](https://clojurecivitas.goatcounter.com/) indicate how widely your idea is being shared.

### Editing the Civitas Explorer Database

An open effort to structure learning resources with meaningful connections.
Add to or modify [site/db.edn](site/db.edn).
The goal is to create a database of resources for learning.
See the [explorer](https://clojurecivitas.github.io/civitas/explorer.html).

## Design

Align with Clojure's values: simplicity, community, and tooling that helps you think.

### Namespace Selection

A namespace serves as a clear, unique path to its content and follows **Clojure‚Äôs naming conventions**.

The namespace should emphasize **what the narrative is about**, not how it is categorized.
Think of it as a logical path that leads to a specific artifact or topic.
Classification elements such as tags, author, document type, level, or publication date belong in **metadata**, not the
namespace.

- **Start with an organization** if the narrative is about a library or tool maintained by one.  
  Examples: `scicloj`, `lambdaisland`.
- **Follow with the specific library or concept.**  
  Examples: `scicloj.clay`, `lambdaisland.kaocha`, `lambdaisland.hiccup`.
- If there is **no organization**, start directly with the library or tool name.  
  Examples: `hiccup`, `reagent`.
- For **core Clojure topics**, use `clojure` as the root.  
  Examples: `clojure.lazy-sequences`, `clojure.transducers`.
- Add **segments** to further qualify the namespace. These segments should:
    - Avoid name collisions.
    - Not duplicate metadata.
    - The last segment should be extra specific and descriptive. Prefer: `z-combinator-gambit`, avoid: `z-combinator`.
- **Events, communities, or topics** may also be used as the top-level namespace when appropriate.  
  Use discretion to determine if the narrative is primarily about an artifact library, a concept, or an event.
- Namespaces must consist of more than one segment.

#### Metadata and Navigation

It may feel unintuitive not to group related content (e.g. an author‚Äôs blog series) by directory or namespace.
But this structure is intentional.
Linear sequences (e.g. blog posts by an author) will be **reconstructed from metadata**, not filenames or folders.
For example, a page showing all blog posts by an author is generated by filtering for `author`, `type = post`, and
`date`, and then ordering by date.

Namespaces prioritize **logical addressing** over ontological hierarchy.
This promotes flexibility at the cost of tidiness, but enables richer discovery through metadata and search.

Differentiation between posts, pages, and presentations is by `type` metadata (a Quarto page type convention).

### File system organization

| Directory | Description                                                  |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `src`     | Source root for namespaces, markdown, images, and data files |
| `site`    | Static assets of the Quarto website                          |

Non-Clojure files in `src` will be synced to `site`.
Shared images can go in `src/images`,
but prefer placing images and data files as siblings to your namespace under `src`.
All files in `src` should go under a subdirectory,
so that it is clear they are not part of the static configuration of `site`.
Clojure namespaces are built to markdown files under `site/{my/namespaced/awesome-idea.qmd}`.
Subdirectories of `site` are git ignored and considered temporary build artifacts, safe to clean up.
Quarto builds all the markdown into HTML in `_site` for preview and deploy.
While developing, Clay uses `temp` to build and serve HTML files.

Goal: Align with Clojure‚Äôs code organization while allowing organic, practical growth.

### Topic organization

Follow the Quarto convention of categories, tags, and keywords.
Fixed categories; `community`, `algorithms`, `data`, `systems`, `libs`, `concepts`.
Tags; flexible, open-ended for finer-grained labeling (e.g. `frontend`, `reagent`).
Keywords; for SEO or search indexing; typically fewer and focused on discoverability.

Tags and metadata are the preferred organization principle:
[Categories, Links, and Tags](https://gwern.net/doc/philosophy/ontology/2005-04-shirky-ontologyisoverratedcategorieslinksandtags.html)

Goal: Constellations, not cabinets.

### Dependency management

A single `deps.edn` file is shared.

Pros:

* Simplifies website builds.
* Works for authoring as well as building.

Cons:

* Version conflicts must be manually resolved.
* Only one version per dependency.
* Pages and posts aren‚Äôt self-contained.

Future:

* Support additional directories under `standalone` with their own `deps.edn`.
* Regression testing would help when versions update.

Goal: Minimize friction in authoring while ensuring publishable reproducibility.
