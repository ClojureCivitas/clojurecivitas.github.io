;;
;; Scicloj has been expanding, not only as a group for open source projects with data science in Clojure,
;; but also as a community that welcomes anyone who wants to learn, contribute,
;; or share fun stories of their enthusiasm for Clojure.
;;
;; Over the previous conferences hosted by Scicloj, we’ve had the pleasure of
;; meeting many talented and creative minds. It’s been inspiring, and we want more!
;;
;; ## Clojure Jam - The Event
;;
;; There are many ways of expressing creativity, including through code.
;; So we want to host a special event in April 2026 (firm dates TBD) to explore
;; creative and artistic coding projects, and call it [Clojure Jam 2026](https://scicloj.github.io/clojure-jam-2026/)!
;;
;; We are looking for talk submissions such as:
;;
;; - Sharing creative coding work, and what you like about creative coding
;; - Jam sessions to celebrate the event with live music and/or visual art
;; - Workshops that demonstrate how to be a creative coder
;; - The fundamentals of arts - like “what is sound or color?”, “how does frequency relate to the experience of sound”, “data visualization principles 101”, etc.
;;
;; ## Call for Speakers and Instructors
;;
;; Do any of the above sound interesting to you? If so, please check out [our submission guide page](https://scicloj.github.io/clojure-jam-2026/speakers.html)!
;; Or if you have some ideas that need further brainstorming,
;; or some if you have questions, please reach out to us!
;;
;; We want to feature creative talks/performances, hands-on workshops, live coding,
;; discussions, and to publish all these stories on Clojure Civitas!
;;
;; ## BTW
;;
;; We’ll definitely continue to organize more events dedicated to working with
;; Clojure in data science in the future as we have in the past.
;; But we thought it would be worthwhile to make some time to explore all our artistic sides, too.
