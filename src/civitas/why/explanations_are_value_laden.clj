;; These two messages are connected.
;; Today, I explore how.
;;
;; What is worthwhile to explain? Anything? No.
;;
;; I can explain the number of grains of sand on a beach.
;; That explanation is *not interesting* compared to what I *could* be explaining.
;; I would rather explain how numbers with units of measure helps you write clearer code.
;; How you can use a drop of science to spice up your world of software development.
;; How a sliver of programming can help you move the world as a designer.
;;
;; I feel zero need to explain how to “nudge” people into making decisions they do not want to make.
;; I feel zero need to add more mess, chaos, advertisement and coercion into an already confusing and coercive world.
;; Why am I bombarded with messaging to change my behavior every place I see?
;; Why does this happen even when I use services I pay for?
;; I despise this trend.
;;
;; So what?
;; Then what?
;; What should we do instead?
;;
;; Just as the will to explain comes from your values, you can value great explanations.
;; Instead of consuming coercive messaging, consider exploring.
;; Later, share the bits and pieces you discovered.
;; What was your journey?
;; Can you explain what you discovered?
;;
;; I spoke to a friend about great explanations last weekend.
;; “We need to explain together!”, I said.
;; “That is what it means to be human!”
;; “What about art?”, he said.
;; “That's a very good question”.
;;
;; After a brief detour into “art as digestion”, we returned to explanations.
;; Science is the pursuit of better explanations.
;;
;; “But science is scary!”, he retorted at once.
;;
;; No!
;; Let us not fear science.
;; Let us respect science and respect great scientists.
;; But let us forever not fear science.
;; We explain to each other all the time.
;; And those explanations will help others.
;; They will help ourselves.
;;
;; I value great explanations.
;; I value the pursuit of great explanations.
;; And I find it worthwhile to pursue great explanations with others.
;;
;; I may grasp something in a brief moment.
;; By turning that understanding into an explanation, the understanding can outlive the moment.
;; Knowing I can return to that understanding, I can move on.
