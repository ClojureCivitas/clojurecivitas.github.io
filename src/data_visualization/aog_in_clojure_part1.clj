;; **A Design Exploration for a plotting API**
;;
;; This is the first post in a series documenting the design and implementation of a new
;; compositional plotting API for Clojure. We're exploring fresh approaches to declarative
;; data visualization, drawing inspiration from Julia's [AlgebraOfGraphics.jl](https://aog.makie.org/stable/)
;; while staying true to Clojure's values of simplicity and composability.
;;
;; Each post in this series combines narrative explanation with executable code — this is a
;; working Clojure notebook that can be used with
;; [Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly/)-compatible
;; tools like [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/).
;; Code examples are tested using
;; [Clay's test generation](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/clay_book.test_generation.html).
;; You'll see the API evolve from basic scatter plots through faceting, statistical transforms,
;; and support for multiple rendering backends. By the end, we'll have a complete prototype
;; that handles real-world plotting tasks while maintaining an inspectable design.

;; You may consider the design and implementation here
;; *a draft* for a future library API.
;;
;; ### 📖 A Bit of Context: Tableplot's Journey
;;
;; Before we dive into the technical details, let's talk about where we're coming from.
;;
;; [Tableplot](https://scicloj.github.io/tableplot/) was created in mid-2024 as a pragmatic plotting solution for the
;; [Noj](https://scicloj.github.io/noj/) toolkit—Clojure's growing data science
;; and scientific computing ecosystem. We needed *something* that worked, and we
;; needed it soon. The goal was to add to Noj's offering:
;; a way to visualize data without leaving Clojure or reaching for external tools.
;;
;; Since then, Tableplot's current APIs 
;; ([`scicloj.tableplot.v1.hanami`](https://scicloj.github.io/tableplot/tableplot_book.hanami_walkthrough.html) and
;; [`scicloj.tableplot.v1.plotly`](https://scicloj.github.io/tableplot/tableplot_book.plotly_walkthrough.html)) 
;; have been used in quite a few serious projects.
;;
;; However, we never intended these APIs to be the final word on
;; plotting in Clojure. They were a decent compromise—pragmatic, functional,
;; good enough to be useful. Better designs have been waiting to be explored.
;;
;; ### Learning from Our Users
;;
;; The feedback from Tableplot users has been invaluable. **Thank you** to everyone
;; who took the time to file issues, ask questions, share use cases, and push the
;; library in directions we hadn't anticipated. Your patience with the rough edges
;; and your insights about what works (and what doesn't) have shaped this next iteration.
;;
;; ### The Real-World Data Dev Group
;;
;; This work is also happening in the context of the
;; [Real-World Data dev group](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/real-world-data/),
;; recently reinitiated by Timothy Pratley with new spirit and a stronger focus on
;; open-source collaboration.
;;
;; With that context in mind, let's explore what we're building.

;; # Context & Motivation
;;
;; ## 📖 Why Explore a New Approach?
;;
;; Tableplot currently provides two visualization APIs: `scicloj.tableplot.v1.hanami`
;; for [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) visualizations, and 
;; `scicloj.tableplot.v1.plotly` for [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/).
;; Both have proven useful in real projects, but they've also revealed some constraints
;; that are worth thinking about fresh.
;;
;; The `hanami` API extends the original Hanami library, inheriting its template
;; substitution system with uppercase keywords like `:X` and `:Y`. This brings
;; backwards compatibility requirements that affect both APIs, since `plotly`
;; shares some infrastructure with `hanami`. When you want to change something
;; fundamental, you have to consider the impact across multiple layers.
;;
;; Each API is also tied to a specific rendering target. If you choose `hanami`,
;; you get Vega-Lite—which works for many use cases but has limitations
;; with certain coordinate systems. If you choose `plotly`, you get interactivity
;; but rendering static images programmatically becomes tricky. When you hit a
;; limitation of your chosen rendering target, switching means learning a different API.
;;
;; The intermediate representation between the API and the renderers uses Hanami
;; templates. Template substitution is flexible, but it can be
;; open-ended and difficult to understand when debugging. Error messages sometimes
;; reference template internals rather than your code, and it's not always clear
;; which substitution parameters are valid in which contexts.
;;
;; The APIs also currently expect [tech.ml.dataset](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset) 
;; datasets. If you have a simple Clojure map or vector, you need to convert it 
;; first—even for simple visualizations.
;;
;; ## 📖 What We're Exploring
;;
;; Some of these limitations will be addressed within the current APIs themselves—
;; we're actively working on improvements. But as we always intended, it's valuable
;; to explore fresh solutions in parallel. A fresh design lets us ask questions
;; that are harder to answer incrementally: Can we design an API where the intermediate
;; representation is plain maps that are easy to inspect and manipulate with standard
;; operations, while working harmoniously with both a functional interface and multiple
;; rendering targets?
;;
;; This notebook prototypes an alternative compositional API to explore these ideas.
;; It's not meant to replace the existing Tableplot APIs—it might become an additional
;; namespace coexisting with `hanami` and `plotly`, or it might inform future design
;; decisions. This is for Tableplot maintainers, contributors, and curious users who
;; want to provide early feedback on the approach.

;; # Setup

;; ## ⚙️ Dependencies
;;
;; This notebook relies on several libraries from the Clojure data science ecosystem.
;; Here's what we use and why:

(ns data-visualization.aog-in-clojure-part1
  (:require
   ;; Tablecloth - Dataset manipulation
   [tablecloth.api :as tc]
   [tablecloth.column.api :as col]

   ;; Kindly - Notebook visualization protocol
   [scicloj.kindly.v4.kind :as kind]

   ;; thi.ng/geom-viz - Static SVG visualization
   [thi.ng.geom.viz.core :as viz]
   [thi.ng.geom.svg.core :as svg]

   ;; Fastmath - Statistical computations
   [fastmath.ml.regression :as regr]
   [fastmath.stats :as stats]

   ;; Malli - Schema validation
   [malli.core :as m]
   [malli.error :as me]
   [malli.util :as mu]

   ;; RDatasets - Example datasets
   [scicloj.metamorph.ml.rdatasets :as rdatasets]))

;; [**Tablecloth**](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/) provides our dataset API, wrapping 
;; [tech.ml.dataset](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset) with a
;; friendly interface. We use it to manipulate data and access column types.
;;
;; **Key insight**: Tablecloth provides column type information via `tablecloth.column.api/typeof`,
;; which eliminates the need for complex type inference.
;;
;; [**Kindly**](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly-noted/) is the visualization protocol that lets this notebook render
;; plots in different environments ([Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/), [Portal](https://github.com/djblue/portal), etc.). Each rendering target returns
;; a Kindly-wrapped spec.
;;
;; [**thi.ng/geom**](https://github.com/thi-ng/geom) gives us the static SVG target for visualizations that can be saved as images.
;; We specifically use
;; [geom.viz](https://github.com/thi-ng/geom/blob/feature/no-org/org/examples/viz/demos.org) for data visualization.
;;
;; [**Fastmath**](https://github.com/generateme/fastmath) handles our statistical computations, particularly linear
;; regression. It's a comprehensive math library for Clojure.
;;
;; [**Malli**](https://github.com/metosin/malli) provides schema validation for plot specifications.
;; We define schemas for layers, aesthetics, and plot types to catch errors early
;; and generate helpful error messages. Validation is optional but recommended.
;;
;; [**RDatasets**](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html) provides classic datasets (penguins, mtcars, iris) for examples.
;; It is made available in Clojure through [metamorph.ml](https://github.com/scicloj/metamorph.ml).

;; # Inspiration: AlgebraOfGraphics.jl
;;
;; This design is inspired by Julia's [AlgebraOfGraphics.jl](https://aog.makie.org/stable/),
;; a visualization library that builds on decades of experience from systems
;; like [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) while introducing clear compositional principles.
;;
;; As the [AoG philosophy](https://aog.makie.org/stable/philosophy) states:

;; > "In a declarative framework, the user needs to express the _question_, and the 
;; > library will take care of creating the visualization."
;;
;; This approach of 
;; ["describing a higher-level 'intent' how your tabular data should be transformed"](https://aog.makie.org/dev/tutorials/intro-i)
;; aligns naturally with Clojure's functional and declarative tendencies—something
;; we've seen in libraries like Hanami, Tableplot, and others in the ecosystem.
;;
;; We chose AoG because it seemed well-thought, small enough to grasp and reproduce, while still being
;; reasonably complete in its scope.

;; ## 📖 Glossary: Visualization Terminology
;;
;; Before diving deeper, let's clarify some terms we'll use throughout:
;;
;; **Domain** - The extent of input values from your data. For a column of bill lengths 
;; containing values 32.1, 45.3, and 59.6, the domain extends from 32.1 to 59.6. This is *data space*.
;;
;; **Range** - The extent of output values in the visualization. For an x-axis that spans 
;; from pixel 50 to pixel 550, the range extends from 50 to 550. This is *visual space*.
;;
;; **Scale** - The mapping function from domain to range. A [linear scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(ratio))
;; maps data value 32.1 → pixel 50, and 59.6 → pixel 550, with proportional mapping in between.
;; Other scale types include logarithmic, time, and categorical.
;;
;; **Aesthetic** - A visual property that can encode data. Common aesthetics: `x` position, 
;; `y` position, `color`, `size`, `shape`, `alpha` (opacity). Each aesthetic needs 
;; a scale to map data to visual values.
;;
;; **Mapping** - The connection between a data column and an aesthetic. "Map `:bill-length` 
;; to `x` aesthetic" means "use the bill-length values to determine x positions."
;;
;; **Coordinate System** - The spatial framework for positioning marks. [Cartesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) 
;; (standard x/y grid), [polar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system) (angle/radius), 
;; and [geographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system) (latitude/longitude) 
;; interpret positions differently and affect domain computation.
;;
;; **Statistical Transform** - A computation that derives new data from raw data. Examples: 
;; [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) (fit line), 
;; [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) (bin and count), 
;; [kernel density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) (smooth distribution).
;;
;; **Layer** (in AoG sense) - A composable unit containing data, mappings, visual marks, 
;; and optional transforms. Different from ggplot2's "layer" (which means overlaid visuals).
;;
;; **Rendering Target** - The library that produces final output: thi.ng/geom, 
;; Vega-Lite, or Plotly.

;; ## 📖 Core Insight: Layers + Operations
;;
;; AlgebraOfGraphics.jl treats visualization with two key ideas:
;;
;; **1. Everything is a [layer](https://aog.makie.org/dev/tutorials/intro-i#Layers:-data,-mapping,-visual-and-transformation)**: 
;; Data, mappings, visuals, and transformations all compose the same way
;;
;; - Data sources
;; - Aesthetic mappings (x → column, color → column)
;; - Visual marks (scatter, line, bar)
;; - Statistical transformations (regression, smoothing)
;;
;; *(Note: This is a different notion from "layers" in
;; the [layered grammar of graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html) used by ggplot2 and Vega-Lite,
;; where layers specifically refer to overlaid visual marks. In AoG, "layer" is the fundamental 
;; compositional unit containing data, mappings, visuals, and transformations.)*
;;
;; **2. Two operations**: `*` (product) and `+` (sum)
;;
;; - `*` **merges** layers together (composition)
;;   ```julia
;;   data(penguins) * mapping(:bill_length, :bill_depth) * visual(Scatter)
;;   # → Single layer with all properties combined
;;   ```
;;
;; - `+` **overlays** layers (overlay)
;;   ```julia
;;   visual(Scatter) + visual(Lines)
;;   # → Two separate visual marks on same plot
;;   ```
;;
;; **3. Distributive property**: `a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)`
;;
;;   ```julia
;;   data(penguins) * mapping(:bill_length, :bill_depth) * 
;;       (visual(Scatter) + linear())
;;   # ↓ expands to
;;   (data(penguins) * mapping(:bill_length, :bill_depth) * visual(Scatter)) + 
;;   (data(penguins) * mapping(:bill_length, :bill_depth) * linear())
;;   ```
;;
;; This allows factoring out common properties and applying them to
;; multiple plot types without repetition.

;; ## 📖 Comparison to ggplot2
;;
;; ggplot2 uses `+` for everything:
;; ```r
;; ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + 
;;   geom_point() +
;;   geom_smooth()
;; ```
;;
;; AlgebraOfGraphics separates concerns:
;; ```julia
;; data(df) * mapping(:x, :y) * (visual(Scatter) + smooth())
;; ```
;;
;; **Why two operators?** The separation brings clarity—`*` means "combine properties" 
;; while `+` means "overlay visuals"—and enables composability.

;; ## 📖 Translating to Clojure
;;
;; Julia's approach relies on custom `*` and `+` operators defined on Layer types,
;; using multiple dispatch to handle different type combinations with object-oriented
;; layer representations. This works in Julia's type system.
;;
;; One of our goals here would be bringing this compositional approach while staying
;; true to Clojure idioms: using plain data structures (maps, not objects), enabling
;; standard library operations like `merge`, `assoc`, and `filter`, maintaining the
;; compositional benefits, and making the intermediate representation transparent and
;; inspectable. How do we get the compositional approach of AoG while keeping everything
;; as simple Clojure data?

;; # Design Exploration
;;
;; The core design question: how should we structure layer specifications
;; so they compose naturally with Clojure's standard library?

;; ## 📖 The Problem: Nested Doesn't Merge

(def nested-layer-example
  {:transformation nil
   :data {:bill-length-mm [39.1 39.5 40.3]
          :bill-depth-mm [18.7 17.4 18.0]
          :species [:adelie :adelie :adelie]}
   :positional [:bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm]
   :named {:color :species}
   :attributes {:alpha 0.5}})

;; Standard `merge` doesn't compose nested structures:

(merge {:positional [:x] :named {:color :species}}
       {:positional [:y] :named {:size :body-mass}})
;; Lost `:x` and `:color`.

;; Nested structure requires a custom `merge-layer` function. Not ideal.

;; ## 📖 The Solution: Flat Structure with Distinctive Keys

(def flat-layer-example
  {:=data {:bill-length-mm [39.1 39.5 40.3]
           :bill-depth-mm [18.7 17.4 18.0]
           :species [:adelie :adelie :adelie]}
   :=x :bill-length-mm
   :=y :bill-depth-mm
   :=color :species
   :=alpha 0.5
   :=plottype :scatter})

;; ## 📖 The Solution Works: Standard Merge Composes

;; Standard `merge` preserves all properties - nothing lost:

(merge {:=x :bill-length-mm :=color :species}
       {:=y :bill-depth-mm :=alpha 0.5})

;; This is why `=*` (our composition operator) can use standard `merge` internally.

;; # Design Overview
;;
;; Before diving into implementation details, let's preview the key design decisions
;; and what the API will look like.

;; ## 📖 Key Design Decisions
;;
;; **1. Flat structure with distinctive `:=` keys**
;;   - Layer specs are plain maps: `{:=data ... :=x ... :=y ... :=plottype ...}`
;;   - Standard `merge` composes correctly (as shown above)
;;   - No collision with data columns (`:=x` ≠ `:x`)
;;
;; **2. Two compositional operators**
;;   - `=*` merges layers (like Julia's `*`): `(=* data mapping geom)`
;;   - `=+` overlays layers (like Julia's `+`): `(=+ scatter linear)`
;;   - Threading-macro friendly, implicitly merging: `(-> data (mapping :x :y) (scatter))`
;;
;; **3. Minimal delegation strategy**
;;   - We compute: statistical transforms, domains (when needed)
;;   - We delegate: axis rendering, tick placement, "nice numbers"
;;   - Why: transforms need domains first; rendering libs handle layout better
;;
;; **4. Type-aware grouping**
;;   - Tablecloth gives us column types via `col/typeof` for free
;;   - Categorical aesthetics (`:=color :species`) create groups for transforms
;;   - Continuous aesthetics are visual-only (no grouping)
;;   - Explicit `:=group` aesthetic for manual control
;;
;; **5. Map-based internal representation (IR)**
;;   - Plot specs are maps with `:=layers` key containing vector of layer specs
;;   - Plot-level properties (`:=target`, `:=width`, `:=height`, scales) separate from layers
;;   - Enables clear distinction between plot configuration and layer data
;;   - This separation enables clean composition and clear semantics for plot configuration
;;
;; **6. Multi-target rendering**
;;   - Same plot spec works across `:geom`, `:vl`, `:plotly` rendering targsts
;;   - Backend selection via `:=target` key
;;   - Consistent behavior and theming

;; ## 📖 API Preview
;;
;; The API will consist of:
;;
;; **Layer-level properties** - build partial layer specs:
;; - `(data dataset)` - attach data
;; - `(mapping :x :y {:color :species})` - define aesthetic mappings  
;; - `(scatter)`, `(linear)`, `(histogram)` - specify plot types/transforms
;;
;; **Plot-level properties** - configure rendering and scales:
;; - `(target :geom)` - specify rendering target (:geom, :vl, :plotly)
;; - `(size 800 600)` - set plot dimensions
;; - `(scale :x {:domain [0 100]})` - customize axis scales
;; - `(facet {:col :species})` - add faceting
                                        ;
;; **Composition operators** - combine specs:
;; - `(=* data mapping geom)` - merge properties (cross-product for layers, merge for plot-level)
;; - `(=+ scatter linear)` - overlay layers with inheritance (concatenate `:=layers`, merge plot-level)
                                        ;
;; **Rendering**:
;; - `(plot spec)` - explicitly render (usually auto-displays)
;;
;; **Auto-display:** Plot specs returned by `=*`, `=+`, and constructors automatically
;; display as plots in Kindly-compatible notebooks. Use `kind/pprint` to inspect
;; the raw plot spec map (with `:=layers` key) instead.
;;
;; **Want to see it in action?** Skip ahead to [Basic Scatter Plots](#basic-scatter-plots)
;; to see the API working, or continue reading for implementation details.

;; ## 📖 How Plots are Displayed
;;
;; Layer specifications returned by `*` and `+` are **automatically displayed as plots**
;; in the notebook. This means you typically don't need to call `plot` explicitly.
;;
;; ```clojure
;; ;; Auto-displays as plot:
;; (-> penguins
;;     (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
;;     (scatter))
;;
;; ;; To inspect the raw layer data, use kind/pprint:
;; (kind/pprint
;;   (-> penguins
;;       (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
;;       (scatter)))
;;
;; ;; To get the target spec (for debugging or customization):
;; (plot
;;   (-> penguins
;;       (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
;;       (scatter)))
;; ```
;;
;; **When to use `plot` explicitly**:
;; - Debugging: Inspect the Plotly.js/Vega-Lite/SVG spec
;; - Customization: Post-process the spec with target-specific features
;; - Extension: Add features not yet supported by the layer API
;;
;; **When to use `kind/pprint`**:
;; - Inspect the raw layer specification (`:=...` keys)
;; - Understand how composition merges layers
;; - Debug layer construction before rendering

;; ## 📖 Implementation Status
;;
;; This notebook implements a working prototype with:
;;
;; **Core features:**
;; - ✅ Compositional operators (`=*`, `=+`) with threading-macro support
;; - ✅ Plain Clojure data (maps, vectors - no dataset required)
;; - ✅ Type-aware grouping (categorical aesthetics create groups)
;; - ✅ Three rendering targets (`:geom`, `:vl`, `:plotly`) with feature parity
;; - ✅ Malli schemas with validation and helpful error messages
;;
;; **Plot types & transforms:**
;; - ✅ Scatter, line, histogram
;; - ✅ Linear regression (with grouping support)
;; - ✅ Faceting (row, column, and grid layouts)
;; - ✅ Custom scale domains
;;
;; **Not yet implemented** (compared to `tableplot.v1.plotly`):
;; - ⚠️ Bar, box, violin, density, smooth, heatmap, text, segment
;; - ⚠️ Additional aesthetics: size, symbol/shape, fill, line-width  
;; - ⚠️ Transforms: kernel density, loess/spline smoothing, correlation
;; - ⚠️ Coordinate systems: 3D, polar, geographic
;; - ⚠️ Advanced layouts: subplots, secondary axes, insets
;; - ⚠️ Interactivity: hover templates, click events, selections
;;
;; Missing features are deferred, not abandoned - the design should accommodate
;; them without fundamental restructuring.

;; Now that we've explored why a flat structure with distinctive keys works well
;; for composition, let's see how this design is implemented. The following sections
;; walk through the key implementation details: rendering targets, delegation strategy,
;; and the core API functions.

;; # Rendering Targets
;;
;; This API is designed to work with multiple **rendering targets**—the actual
;; visualization libraries that produce the final output. Each target has different
;; strengths:
;;
;; - **`:geom`** ([thi.ng/geom](https://github.com/thi-ng/geom)) - Static SVG, easy to save to files
;; - **`:vl`** ([Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)) - Interactive web visualizations, some coordinate system limitations
;; - **`:plotly`** ([Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/)) - Interactive with 3D support, static export is tricky
;;
;; The idea: you write your plot specification once using our API, and it can be
;; rendered by different targets. This separates **what** you want to visualize from
;; **how** it gets rendered.

;; # The Delegation Strategy
;;
;; Since we support multiple rendering targets, we need to decide what to compute
;; ourselves versus what to delegate to each target library.
;;
;; ## 📖 Core Principle
;;
;; **Statistical transforms require domain computation. Everything else delegates.**
;;
;; Transforms like histograms and regression need to know data extents before
;; computing derived data. So we compute:
;; - Statistical transforms (histogram bins, regression lines)
;; - Domains when needed (always for `:geom`, only custom for `:vl`/`:plotly`)
;; - Type information (from Tablecloth's `col/typeof`)
;;
;; We delegate to rendering targets:
;; - Axis rendering, tick placement, "nice numbers"
;; - Range computation (pixels/visual coordinates)  
;; - Scale merging across layers
;;
;; This gives us control where it matters (correctness, consistency) while
;; leveraging mature tools where they excel (formatting, layout).
;;
;; **Why compute transforms ourselves?**

;; 1. Consistency - We want the visualizations to match the 
;; statistical computations of our Clojure libraries.
;; 2. Efficiency - Especially with browser-based rendering targets,
;; what we wish to pass to the target is summaries (say, 20 histogram bars)
;; tather than raw data (say, 1M points).

;; # Malli Schemas
;;
;; Before diving into the API implementation, we define the schemas that validate
;; our plot specifications. These schemas serve three purposes:
;;
;; 1. **Documentation** - They formally specify what constitutes a valid plot
;; 2. **Runtime validation** - They catch errors early with clear messages
;; 3. **Type safety** - They ensure plot construction is correct
;;
;; **You can skip this section** and jump directly to [Basic Scatter Plots](#basic-scatter-plots)
;; to see the API in action. Come back here later when you want to understand
;; validation details or see what fields are available.
;;
;; **Key schema:** `PlotSpec` defines the complete plot structure with `:=layers`
;; and plot-level properties (`:=target`, `:=width`, `:=height`, scales, etc.).

;; ## ⚙️ Malli Registry Setup
;;
;; Create a registry that includes both default schemas and malli.util schemas.
;; This enables declarative schema utilities like :merge, :union, :select-keys.

(def registry
  "Malli registry with default schemas and util schemas (for :merge, etc.)"
  (merge (m/default-schemas) (mu/schemas)))

;; ## ⚙️ Core Type Schemas

(def DataType
  "Schema for column data types.
  
  - :quantitative - Continuous numeric values
  - :nominal - Categorical/discrete unordered values
  - :ordinal - Categorical/discrete ordered values
  - :temporal - Date/time values"
  [:enum :quantitative :nominal :ordinal :temporal])

(def PlotType
  "Schema for plot/mark types."
  [:enum :scatter :line :area :bar :histogram])

(def Transformation
  "Schema for statistical transformations."
  [:enum :linear :smooth :density :bin :histogram])

(def BinsMethod
  "Schema for histogram binning methods."
  [:or
   [:enum :sturges :sqrt :rice :freedman-diaconis]
   pos-int?])

;; ## ⚙️ Data Schemas

(def Dataset
  "Schema for dataset input.

  - Vector of maps (row-oriented data)
  - tech.ml.dataset (tablecloth dataset)"

;; **Why this works**:
;;
;; - Standard `merge` composes correctly (flat structure)
;; - No collision with data columns (`:=plottype` ≠ `:plottype`)
;; - All standard library operations work: `assoc`, `update`, `mapv`, `filter`, `into`

;; # API Implementation
;;
;; This section implements the core API: the composition operators (`=*`, `=+`),
;; constructors (`data`, `mapping`, `scatter`, etc.), and the rendering function.
;; These are the functions you'll actually call when creating plots.

(defn plot
  "Unified rendering function supporting multiple targets.

  Most users should rely on auto-display and never call this directly.

  Use `plot` explicitly when you need:
  - Custom width/height options
  - Access to the raw target specification for debugging or customization

  Args:
  - spec: Plot spec map with :=layers
  - opts: Optional map with:
    - :width - Width in pixels (default 600)
    - :height - Height in pixels (default 400)
    - :target - Rendering target (:geom, :vl, :plotly)

  The rendering target is determined by:
  1. :target in opts (highest priority)
  2. `:=target` key in spec (set via `target` function)
  3. :geom (static SVG) as default

  Returns:
  - Kindly-wrapped visualization specification

  Examples:
  ;; Get raw spec for customization:
  (plot spec {:width 800 :height 600})

  (plot (-> data (mapping :x :y) (scatter))

  return values, so most users never call this function directly.

;; Plot-level properties (non-layer keys) merge with right-side wins:

                       (= (:=height %) 300))])

;; ### 🧪 Example: =+ Overlay Without Inheritance

;; The `=+` operator concatenates layers when both specs have plottypes:

(kind/pprint
 (=+ {:=layers [{:=plottype :scatter :=alpha 0.5}]}
     {:=layers [{:=plottype :line :=color :blue}]}))

;; ### 🧪 Example: =+ Inheritance Pattern

;; When first spec has incomplete layer (no plottype), it provides shared properties:

;; This is the pattern used in threading forms:
;; (-> (mapping data :x :y) (=+ (scatter) (linear)))

;; ### 🧪 Example: =+ Merges Plot-Level Properties

;; ## 🧪 Plot-Level Properties Examples
;;
;; Plot-level properties configure rendering and scales for the entire plot,
;; as opposed to layer-level properties that apply to individual visual marks.
;; In practice, you'll typically compose these with data, mappings, and geoms
;; using `=*`. These isolated examples show what each property constructor returns.

;; ### 🧪 Example: target Constructor

;; The `target` constructor sets the rendering backend:

(kind/pprint
 (target :vl))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (= (:=target %) :vl)
                       (not (contains? % :=layers)))])

;; Threading form merges target with existing spec:

(kind/pprint
 (-> {:=layers [{:=data {:x [1 2 3] :y [4 5 6]}}]}
     (target :plotly)))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=target %) :plotly)
                       (= (:=data (first (:=layers %))) {:x [1 2 3] :y [4 5 6]}))])

;; ### 🧪 Example: scale Constructor

;; The `scale` constructor sets custom domains:

(kind/pprint
 (scale :x {:domain [0 100]}))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=scale-x)
                       (= (get-in % [:=scale-x :domain]) [0 100])
                       (not (contains? % :=layers)))])

;; Multiple scales can be composed:

(kind/pprint
 (=* (scale :x {:domain [0 100]})
     (scale :y {:domain [0 50]})))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=scale-x)
                       (contains? % :=scale-y)
                       (= (get-in % [:=scale-x :domain]) [0 100])
                       (= (get-in % [:=scale-y :domain]) [0 50]))])

;; Threading form merges scale with plot spec:

(kind/pprint
 (-> {:=layers [{:=x :a :=y :b}]}
     (scale :x {:domain [30 60]})))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (contains? % :=scale-x)
                       (= (get-in % [:=scale-x :domain]) [30 60]))])

;; ### 🧪 Example: size Constructor

;; The `size` constructor sets plot dimensions:

(kind/pprint
 (size 800 600))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (= (:=width %) 800)
                       (= (:=height %) 600)
                       (not (contains? % :=layers)))])

;; Threading form merges size with plot spec:

(kind/pprint
 (-> {:=layers [{:=x :a :=y :b}]}
     (size 1000 500)))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=width %) 1000)
                       (= (:=height %) 500))])

;; ### 🧪 Example: Composing Multiple Plot-Level Properties

;; All plot-level properties compose via `=*`:

(kind/pprint
 (=* (target :vl)
     (size 800 600)
     (scale :x {:domain [0 100]})))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (= (:=target %) :vl)
                       (= (:=width %) 800)
                       (= (:=height %) 600)
                       (contains? % :=scale-x))])

;; This section contains the foundational helper functions and the core

;; This makes it easy to add new targets: define [:vl :scatter], [:plotly :scatter], etc.

;; ## ⚙️ Implementation

;; ### ⚙️ Constructor

(defn scatter
  "Create a scatter plot layer.
  
  A scatter plot displays individual data points as marks (circles) positioned
  according to their x and y values. Useful for showing relationships between
  two continuous variables or the distribution of discrete points.
  
  Args (when provided):
  - attrs-or-spec: Either a map of attributes {:alpha 0.5} or a plot spec to compose with
  - attrs: (2-arg form) Map of visual attributes like {:alpha 0.5}
  
  Attributes:
  - :alpha - Opacity (0.0 to 1.0, default 1.0)
  
  Returns:
  - Plot spec map with :=layers containing a scatter layer
  
  Forms:
  
  1. No args - Returns basic scatter layer:
     (scatter)
     ;; => {:=layers [{:=plottype :scatter}]}
  
  2. With attributes - Returns scatter layer with custom attributes:
     (scatter {:alpha 0.5})
     ;; => {:=layers [{:=plottype :scatter :=alpha 0.5}]}
  
  3. Threading form - Composes with existing spec:
     (-> (data penguins)
         (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
         (scatter))
     ;; => {:=layers [{:=data penguins :=x ... :=y ... :=plottype :scatter}]}
  
  4. Threading with attributes:
     (-> (data penguins)
         (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
         (scatter {:alpha 0.7}))
  
  Example - basic scatter plot:
  (-> penguins
      (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
      (scatter))
  
  Example - semi-transparent points:
  (-> penguins
      (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
      (scatter {:alpha 0.5}))
  
  Example - colored by species:
  (-> penguins
      (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
      (scatter))"
  ([]
   {:=layers [{:=plottype :scatter}]})
  ([attrs-or-spec]
   (if (plot-spec? attrs-or-spec)
     (=* attrs-or-spec (scatter))

;; ## 🧪 Examples

;; ### 🧪 Example 1: Simple Scatter Plot (Delegated Domain)

(=* (data penguins)
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (map? (first (:=layers %)))
                       (contains? (first (:=layers %)) :=data)
                       (contains? (first (:=layers %)) :=x)
                       (contains? (first (:=layers %)) :=y)
                       (contains? (first (:=layers %)) :=plottype)
                       (= (:=plottype (first (:=layers %))) :scatter)
                       ;; Also test that it renders to valid HTML
                       (let [rendered (plot %)]
                         (and (map? (meta rendered))
                              (= (:kindly/kind (meta rendered)) :kind/html))))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. We create a plot spec with data, mapping, and plottype
;; 2. The `=*` operator returns a plot spec annotated to auto-display as a plot
;; 3. We DON'T compute X/Y domains
;; 4. Rendering target receives data and computes domain itself
;; 5. This is simpler - we delegate what rendering targets do well.

;; **Inspecting the raw plot specification**:
(kind/pprint
 (=* (data penguins)
     (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
     (scatter)))

;; Notice the `:=layers` key containing layer maps with `:=data`, `:=x`, `:=y`, `:=plottype` keys.
;; This is the compositional plot specification before rendering.

;; ### 🧪 Example 2: Plain Clojure Data Structures

;; The API works with plain Clojure data structures, not just datasets.
;; Two formats are supported:

;; **Map of vectors** (most common for columnar data):
(=* (data {:x [1 2 3 4 5]
           :y [2 4 6 8 10]})
    (mapping :x :y)
    (scatter))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=x (first (:=layers %))) :x)
                       (= (:=y (first (:=layers %))) :y)
                       (map? (:=data (first (:=layers %)))))])

;; **Vector of maps** (row-oriented data):
(=* (data [{:x 1 :y 2}
           {:x 2 :y 4}
           {:x 3 :y 6}
           {:x 4 :y 8}
           {:x 5 :y 10}])
    (mapping :x :y)
    (scatter))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=x (first (:=layers %))) :x)
                       (= (:=y (first (:=layers %))) :y))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Plain Clojure data (no tech.ml.dataset required)
;; 2. Both formats convert seamlessly to datasets internally
;; 3. Type inference works by examining values
;; 4. Helpful errors if data format is invalid

;; This is useful for quick exploration or when working with simple data
;; that doesn't need the full power of tech.ml.dataset.

;; ### 🧪 Example 2b: Threading-Macro Style
;;
;; All the API functions support Clojure's threading macro (`->`), providing
;; a more natural, pipeline-style syntax. This is especially useful for complex
;; visualizations where you're building up layers incrementally.

;; **Simple scatter plot**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=x (first (:=layers %))) :bill-length-mm)
                       (= (:=y (first (:=layers %))) :bill-depth-mm)
                       (= (:=plottype (first (:=layers %))) :scatter))])

;; **With color aesthetic**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
    (scatter))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=color (first (:=layers %))) :species)
                       (= (:=x (first (:=layers %))) :bill-length-mm))])

;; ### 🧪 Example 2c: Semi-Transparent Points
;;
;; Control visual attributes like opacity using the attributes parameter.
;; This is useful when you have overlapping points and want to show density.

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter {:alpha 0.5}))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=alpha (first (:=layers %))) 0.5)
                       (= (:=plottype (first (:=layers %))) :scatter))])

;; **Combining attributes with aesthetics**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
    (scatter {:alpha 0.7}))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=alpha (first (:=layers %))) 0.7)
                       (= (:=color (first (:=layers %))) :species))])

;; ### 🧪 Example 2d: Scale Customization
;;
;; **Combining scale customization**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (scale :x {:domain [30 65]})
    (scale :y {:domain [12 23]}))

;; **What's happening under the hood**:
;;
;; 1. Each function detects whether its first argument is layers (vector with `:=...` keys)
;;    or data (dataset, map-of-vectors, vector-of-maps)
;; 2. If data: converts to layers first via `(data ...)`
;; 3. If layers: merges the new specification using `*`
;; 4. Everything returns vectors, so threading works naturally
;;
;; **Both styles work**:
;;
;; You can use compositional style with `*`:
;; ```clojure
;; (=* (data penguins) (mapping :x :y) (scatter))
;; ```
;;
;; Or threading style with `->`:
;; ```clojure
;; (-> penguins (mapping :x :y) (scatter))
;; ```
;;
;; They produce identical results. Choose whichever feels more natural for your use case.

;; ### 🧪 Example 3: Type Information in Action

;; Now let's see how we can use Tablecloth's type information.
;; We get types for free, no complex inference needed.

;; Note: infer-from-values is defined above with other type helpers

(defn infer-scale-type
  "Infer scale type from values in a layer."
  [layer aesthetic]
  (let [data (:=data layer)
        dataset (ensure-dataset data)
        col-key (get layer (=key aesthetic))
        values (when col-key (tc/column dataset col-key))]
    (cond
      (nil? values) nil
      (every? number? values) :continuous
      (some #(instance? java.time.temporal.Temporal %) values) :temporal
      :else :categorical)))

(let [spec (=* (data penguins)
               (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})

      layer (first (:=layers spec))]
  {:x-type (infer-scale-type layer :=x)
   :y-type (infer-scale-type layer :=y)
   :color-type (infer-scale-type layer :=color)})

;; Notice: Type inference is instant (O(1) lookup from Tablecloth metadata),
;; not O(n) value examination.

;; With linear regression implemented, we can overlay trend lines.

;; # Linear Regression
;; 
;; Statistical transformation: computing and overlaying regression lines.

;; ## ⚙️ Implementation

;; ### ⚙️ Constructor

(defn linear
  "Add linear regression transformation layer.

  Computes the best-fit line through data points using linear regression.
  When combined with a categorical color aesthetic, computes separate
  regression lines for each group automatically.

  The regression is computed using ordinary least squares (OLS) and rendered
  as a line layer. This is a statistical transform - it derives new data
  (the fitted line) from the raw data points.

  Args (when provided):
  - spec-or-data: Plot spec to compose with, or data to create spec from

  Returns:
  - Plot spec map with :=layers containing a linear regression layer

  Forms:

  1. No args - Returns basic linear regression layer:
     (linear)
     ;; => {:=layers [{:=transformation :linear :=plottype :line}]}

  2. Threading with existing spec:
     (-> (data penguins)
         (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
         (linear))
     ;; => Adds regression layer to spec

  3. Composing with data directly:
     (linear penguins)
     ;; => {:=layers [{:=data penguins :=transformation :linear :=plottype :line}]}

  Example - simple linear regression:
  (-> penguins
      (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
      (linear))

  Example - regression with scatter overlay:
  (-> penguins
      (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
      (=+ (scatter {:alpha 0.5})
          (linear)))

  Example - grouped regression by species:
  (-> penguins
      (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
      (=+ (scatter {:alpha 0.5})
          (linear)))
  ;; => Computes separate regression line for each species"

;; ### ⚙️ Constructor

(defn histogram
  "Add histogram transformation layer.

  Bins continuous data into intervals and counts the number of observations
  in each bin. The histogram visualizes the distribution of a single variable.

  This is a statistical transform that requires domain computation - it needs
  to know the data range before determining bin edges. When combined with a
  categorical aesthetic (e.g., :color), computes separate histograms for each
  group.

  Args (when provided):
  - opts-or-spec: Either options map {:bins 20} or plot spec to compose with
  - opts: (2-arg form) Options map

  Options:
  - :bins - Binning method (default :sturges):
    - :sturges - Sturges' formula (good for normal distributions)
    - :sqrt - Square root of n (simple, works for most cases)
    - :rice - Rice's rule (for larger datasets)
    - :freedman-diaconis - Freedman-Diaconis rule (robust to outliers)
    - Integer - Explicit number of bins (e.g., 20)

  Returns:
  - Plot spec map with :=layers containing a histogram layer

  Forms:

  1. No args - Returns basic histogram with default binning:
     (histogram)
     ;; => {:=layers [{:=transformation :histogram :=plottype :bar :=bins :sturges}]}

  2. With options - Custom bin count or method:
     (histogram {:bins 20})
     (histogram {:bins :sqrt})

  3. Threading form:
     (-> penguins
         (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)

  4. Threading with options:
     (-> penguins
         (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)

;; ## 🧪 Examples

;; ### 🧪 Simple Histogram

;; Basic histogram showing distribution of bill lengths:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
    (histogram))

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. We map only `:bill-length-mm` to x (no y mapping for histograms)
;; 2. Histogram transform bins the data using Sturges' rule
;; 3. We compute: domain → bin edges → bin counts
;; 4. Rendering target receives bars (bin ranges + heights), not raw points
;; 5. This shows why we can't fully delegate - we need domain before binning.

;; ### 🧪 Custom Bin Count

;; Try different binning methods:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
    (histogram {:bins 15}))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=transformation (first (:=layers %))) :histogram)
                       (= (:=bins (first (:=layers %))) 15)
                       ;; Verify histogram renders
                       (let [rendered (plot %)]
                         (and (map? (meta rendered))
                              (= (:kindly/kind (meta rendered)) :kind/html))))])

;; ### 🧪 Histogram Binning Methods

;; Different binning algorithms are supported:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
    (histogram {:bins :sqrt}))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=bins (first (:=layers %))) :sqrt))])

;; # Grouping & Color
;; 
;; Type-aware grouping: categorical colors create groups for statistical transforms.

;; ## 🧪 Example 5: Grouping with Categorical Color

;; When you map a **categorical** variable to color, it automatically creates groups
;; for statistical transforms. This matches AlgebraOfGraphics.jl and ggplot2 behavior.

;; **Categorical color → grouped regression**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
    (=+ (scatter {:alpha 0.5})
        (linear)))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (count (:=layers %)) 2)
                       (= (:=color (first (:=layers %))) :species)
                       (= (:=transformation (second (:=layers %))) :linear))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. `:species` is categorical (`:string` type in Tablecloth)
;; 2. System automatically groups by `:species` for the linear transform
;; 3. Computes 3 separate regression lines (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)
;; 4. Each group gets a different color from the ggplot2 palette
;; 5. Scatter points are also colored by species

;; **Categorical color → grouped histogram**:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil {:color :species :alpha 0.7})
    (histogram))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=transformation (first (:=layers %))) :histogram)
                       (= (:=color (first (:=layers %))) :species)
                       (= (:=alpha (first (:=layers %))) 0.7))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Creates 3 separate histograms (one per species)
;; 2. Each histogram uses the same binning method
;; 3. Bars are colored by species
;; 4. Alpha transparency (0.7) lets you see overlapping bars
;; 5. This is different from faceting - bars can overlap/stack

;; ## 🧪 Example 6: Continuous Color (No Grouping)

;; When you map a **continuous** variable to color, it creates a visual gradient
;; but does NOT create groups for statistical transforms.

;; **Continuous color → single regression with gradient**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :body-mass-g})
    (=+ (scatter {:alpha 0.5})
        (linear)))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (count (:=layers %)) 2)
                       (= (:=color (first (:=layers %))) :body-mass-g)
                       (= (:=transformation (second (:=layers %))) :linear))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. `:body-mass-g` is continuous (`:int64` type in Tablecloth)
;; 2. System does NOT group by body mass
;; 3. Computes a single regression line across all points
;; 4. Scatter points are colored by body mass (continuous gradient)
;; 5. The regression line shows overall trend, ignoring color grouping

;; This is the key semantic difference:
;; - Categorical aesthetics → semantic grouping (affects computations)
;; - Continuous aesthetics → visual mapping only (no grouping)

;; ## 🧪 Example 7: Explicit Grouping Override

;; You can explicitly control grouping using the `:group` aesthetic.
;; This lets you group by one variable while coloring by another.

;; **Explicit :group aesthetic**:
(-> mtcars
    (mapping :wt :mpg {:group :cyl})
    (=+ (scatter)
        (linear)))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (count (:=layers %)) 2)
                       (= (:=group (first (:=layers %))) :cyl)
                       (= (:=transformation (second (:=layers %))) :linear))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. `:cyl` (cylinders) could be treated as continuous (it's numeric)
;; 2. But we explicitly group by `:cyl` using `:group`
;; 3. Computes separate regression lines for 4, 6, and 8 cylinder cars
;; 4. No color mapping, so all points/lines use default color

;; **Group different from color**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :sex :group :species})
    (=+ (scatter {:alpha 0.5})
        (linear)))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=color (first (:=layers %))) :sex)
                       (= (:=group (first (:=layers %))) :species)
                       (= (:=transformation (second (:=layers %))) :linear))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Color by `:sex` (2 colors: male/female)
;; 2. Group by `:species` (3 regression lines: Adelie/Chinstrap/Gentoo)
;; 3. Points are colored by sex, but regressions computed per species
;; 4. This shows that grouping and color are independent concepts

;; ## 🧪 Example 8: Using `plot` for Spec Inspection and Customization

;; Most of the time, layers auto-display and you don't need `plot`.
;; But sometimes you want the raw target spec for debugging or customization.
;; See the Multi-Target Rendering section for examples of using `plot`
;; with :vl and :plotly targets.

;; # Faceting
;;
;; Small multiples: splitting data across rows and columns for comparison.

;; ## 📖 Architectural Considerations
;;
;; Implementing faceting has exposed several important design questions:
;;
;; ### 📖 1. Statistical Transforms Must Be Per-Facet
;;
;; **Example**: Histogram of bill-length faceted by species
;; - Semantically: User expects 3 separate histograms (one per species)
;; - Implementation: Must split data by `:species` BEFORE computing histograms
;; - Implication: Can't compute transforms before knowing about facets
;;
;; **Current architecture**: We apply transforms in `plot-impl` after extracting points
;; **Needed**: Apply transforms to each facet group separately
;;
;; ### 📖 2. Domain Computation: Shared vs Free Scales
;;
;; **Shared scales** (ggplot2 default):
;; - All facets use same x/y domain
;; - Pro: Easy to compare across facets
;; - Con: Facets with fewer observations may have compressed ranges
;;
;; **Free scales**:
;; - Each facet optimizes its own domain
;; - Pro: Each facet uses full visual range
;; - Con: Harder to compare magnitudes across facets
;;
;; **Decision**: Start with shared scales (simpler), add `:scales` option later
;;
;; ### 📖 3. Delegation Strategy: Control vs Leverage
;;
;; **Our principle**: We control semantics, targets handle presentation
;;
;; **What we control**:
;; - Data splitting by facet variable
;; - Per-facet transform computation
;; - Domain computation (shared or free)
;; - Color scale consistency
;;
;; **What targets can handle**:
;; - `:geom` - we compute layout positions manually
;; - `:vl`/`:plotly` - could use their grid layout features
;;
;; ### 📖 4. Rendering Architecture for :geom
;;
;; **Challenge**: thi.ng/geom-viz doesn't support multi-panel layouts
;;
;; **Needed**:

;; 1. Calculate panel dimensions (width / num-facets)
;; 2. Calculate panel positions (x-offsets)
;; 3. Create mini-plot for each facet at its position
;; 4. Add facet labels  
;; 5. Combine into single SVG
;;
;; **Complexity**: Significant refactoring of plot-impl :geom
;;
;; ### 📖 5. The Core Insight
;;
;; **Faceting reveals the same pattern as statistical transforms**:
;; - We MUST control the semantics (data splitting, per-group computation)
;; - But we CAN delegate presentation (layout, when targets support it)
;; - This validates our minimal delegation strategy
;;
;; **For statistical transforms + faceting**:
;; ```clojure
;; (plot (facet (=* (data penguins)
;;                  (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
;;                  (histogram))
;;              {:col :species}))
;; ```
;;
;; This requires:

;; 1. Split data by species (3 groups)
;; 2. Compute histogram for EACH group (per-facet transforms)
;; 3. Collect domains across all groups (shared scales)
;; 4. Render 3 mini-histograms side-by-side
;;
;; **This is our value proposition**: Compute on JVM, send summaries to browser.
;; With faceting, even more important!"

;; ## 📖 Design Decisions
;;
;; After prototyping, we've decided:
;;
;; 1. **We control semantics** - Split data, compute transforms per-facet, manage domains
;; 2. **Targets handle presentation** - Layout and rendering (when they can)
;; 3. **Shared scales by default** - All facets use same domain (easier comparison)
;; 4. **Statistical transforms per-facet** - Histogram by species = 3 separate histograms
;;
;; ## ⚙️ Implementation Strategy
;;
;; 1. `split-by-facets` - Groups data by facet variable(s)
;; 2. Apply transforms to each facet group separately
;; 3. Compute domains across all facets (for shared scales)
;; 4. Render each facet as mini-plot
;;
;; For :geom target - compute layout positions manually
;; For :vl/:plotly targets - could use their grid layout features

;; ## 🧪 Examples

;; ### 🧪 Example 10: Simple Column Faceting
;;
;; Facet a scatter plot by species - this creates 3 side-by-side plots.
(=* (data penguins)
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (facet {:col :species}))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=col (first (:=layers %))) :species))])

;; Faceted histogram - per-species histograms with shared scales:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
    (histogram)
    (facet {:col :species}))

;; ### 🧪 Example 11: Row Faceting
;;
;; Facet by rows creates vertically stacked panels

(=* (data penguins)
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (facet {:row :species}))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=row (first (:=layers %))) :species))])

;; ### 🧪 Example 12: Row × Column Grid Faceting
;;
;; Create a 2D grid of facets.
;; This creates a 3×2 grid (3 islands × 2 sexes = 6 panels)

(=* (data penguins)
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (facet {:row :island :col :sex}))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=row (first (:=layers %))) :island)
                       (= (:=col (first (:=layers %))) :sex))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Data split by both `:island` (3 values) and `:sex` (2 values)
;; 2. Creates 3×2 = 6 panels in a grid
;; 3. Column labels at top, row labels on left (rotated)
;; 4. Shared scales across all panels for easy comparison
;; 5. Per-panel rendering with proper x and y offsets

;; ### 🧪 Example 12b: Multiple Grouping Columns (Color + Faceting)
;;
;; When you combine color grouping with faceting, statistical transforms
;; group by BOTH aesthetics. This example shows linear regression grouped
;; by species (color) AND island (facet column), computing separate
;; regressions for each (species × island) combination.

(=* (data penguins)
    (mapping :bill-length-mm
             :bill-depth-mm
             {:color :species})
    (=+ (scatter {:alpha 0.5})
        (linear))
    (facet {:col :island}))

;; equivalently:
(-> (data penguins)
    (mapping :bill-length-mm
             :bill-depth-mm
             {:color :species})
    (=+ (scatter {:alpha 0.5})
        (linear))
    (facet {:col :island}))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (count (:=layers %)) 2)
                       (= (:=col (first (:=layers %))) :island)
                       (= (:=color (first (:=layers %))) :species))])

;; **What happens here**:
;;
;; 1. Faceting by `:island` creates 3 panels (one per island)
;; 2. Color by `:species` creates 3 groups (one per species)
;; 3. Linear regression groups by BOTH: 3 species × 3 islands = 9 regressions
;; 4. Each panel shows 3 colored regression lines (one per species on that island)
;; 5. This demonstrates that `get-grouping-columns` returns `[:species :island]`
;;
;; **Implementation detail**: The `get-grouping-columns` function collects all
;; categorical aesthetics that create groups (:=color, :=col, :=row, :=group)
;; and returns a vector. Transforms then group by the combination of all these columns.

;; ### 🧪 Example 13: Custom Scale Domains
;;
;; Override auto-computed domains to control axis ranges

;; Force y-axis to start at 0
(=* (data mtcars)
    ;; # Scale Customization
    ;; 
    ;; Custom scale domains for precise control over axis ranges.

    (mapping :wt :mpg)
    (scatter)
    (scale :y {:domain [0 40]}))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (get-in % [:=scale-y :domain]) [0 40]))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Y-axis forced to extend from 0 to 40 instead of auto-computed range from 10.4 to 33.9
;; 2. Useful for starting axes at meaningful values (like 0)
;; 3. Custom domains compose via `*` operator

;; Custom domains on both axes
(=* (data penguins)
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (scale :x {:domain [30 65]})
    (scale :y {:domain [10 25]}))

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Both axes use custom ranges
;; 2. Zooms into a specific region of the data
;; 3. Useful for focusing on areas of interest or ensuring consistent scales across multiple plots

;; ## 🧪 Vega-Lite Examples

;; ### 🧪 Example 14: Simple Scatter with Vega-Lite

;; Use `target` to select the `:vl` target (Vega-Lite):

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (target :vl))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (:=target %) :vl)
                       ;; Test that it renders to valid Vega-Lite spec
                       (let [rendered (plot %)]
                         (and (map? rendered)
                              (contains? rendered :data)
                              (contains? rendered :mark)
                              (contains? rendered :encoding))))])

;; **What's different**:

;; 1. Interactive tooltips on hover
;; 2. Vega-Lite's polished default styling
;; 3. Same data, same API, different rendering

;; ### 🧪 Example 15: Multi-Layer with Vega-Lite

;; Scatter + regression works too:

(-> mtcars
    (mapping :wt :mpg)
    (=+ (scatter)
        (linear))
    (target :vl))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (count (:=layers %)) 2)
                       (= (:=target %) :vl))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Scatter plot rendered as VL `point` mark
;; 2. Regression computed on JVM (our delegation strategy!)
;; 3. Fitted line sent to VL as `line` mark
;; 4. VL layers them together

;; ### 🧪 Example 16: Color Mapping with Vega-Lite

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
    (=+ (scatter)
        (linear))
    (target :vl))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=color (first (:=layers %))) :species)
                       (= (:=target %) :vl))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Color mapping becomes VL's color encoding
;; 2. VL provides interactive legend
;; 3. Regression computed per species (3 separate lines)
;; 4. Click legend to filter interactively.

;; **Histogram with Vega-Lite**:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
    (histogram)
    (target :vl))

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Histogram bins computed on JVM using fastmath
;; 2. Bar data sent to VL
;; 3. VL renders as bar chart
;; 4. Interactive tooltips show bin ranges and counts

;; ### 🧪 Example 17: Faceting with Vega-Lite

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (facet {:col :species})
    (target :vl))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=col (first (:=layers %))) :species)
                       (= (:=target %) :vl))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Our API detects faceting specification
;; 2. Delegates to VL's native column faceting
;; 3. VL handles layout and labels
;; 4. Each panel is independently interactive

;; ### 🧪 Example 19: Grid Faceting with Vega-Lite

;; Grid faceting with custom dimensions using compositional `size`:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (facet {:row :island :col :sex})
    (target :vl)
    (size 800 600)
    plot)

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :spec)
                       (contains? % :facet)
                       (= (-> % :facet :row :field) "island")
                       (= (-> % :facet :column :field) "sex"))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. 2D grid faceting using VL's row × column faceting
;; 2. VL handles all layout computation
;; 3. Shared scales across all panels
;; 4. Interactive exploration across the grid

;; ### 🧪 Example 20: Custom Domains with Vega-Lite

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (scale :x {:domain [30 65]})
    (scale :y {:domain [10 25]})
    (target :vl))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (get-in % [:=scale-x :domain]) [30 65])
                       (= (:=target %) :vl))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Custom domains passed to VL's scale specification
;; 2. VL respects our domain constraints
;; 3. Same composition semantics across targets

;; ## 📖 The Power of Backend Agnosticism
;;
;; **Key insight**: Our flat map representation with `:=...` keys creates a
;; separation between plot semantics and rendering implementation.
;;
;; **What we control** (across all targets):
;; - Statistical transforms (regression, histogram)
;; - Data transformations
;; - Composition semantics
;;
;; **What targets handle** (differently):
;; - `:geom` - Static SVG, manual layout, ggplot2-like styling
;; - `:vl` - Interactive web viz, native faceting, Vega-Lite styling
;; - `:plotly` - Rich interactivity, 3D support (coming soon)
;;
;; This is the payoff of our design choices:
;; - Flat maps compose with standard library
;; - Minimal delegation keeps implementation focused
;; - Backend-agnostic IR enables multiple rendering strategies

;; Now we can demonstrate multi-target rendering with the same spec.

;; ## 🧪 Plotly Examples

;; ### 🧪 Example 21: Simple Scatter with Plotly

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (target :plotly))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=target %) :plotly)
                       ;; Test that it renders to valid Plotly spec
                       (let [rendered (plot %)]
                         (and (map? rendered)
                              (contains? rendered :data)
                              (contains? rendered :layout)
                              (sequential? (:data rendered)))))])

;; **What's different from :geom and :vl**:

;; 1. Hover tooltips showing exact x/y values
;; 2. Toolbar with zoom, pan, and download options
;; 3. Smooth animations and transitions
;; 4. Same ggplot2 theming (grey background, white grid)

;; ### 🧪 Example 22: Multi-Layer with Plotly

(-> mtcars
    (mapping :wt :mpg)
    (=+ (scatter)
        (linear))
    (target :plotly))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (count (:=layers %)) 2)
                       (= (:=target %) :plotly))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Scatter plot rendered as Plotly scatter trace
;; 2. Regression computed on JVM (our minimal delegation!)
;; 3. Both traces combined in single Plotly spec
;; 4. Interactive hover works for both layers

;; ### 🧪 Example 23: Color-Grouped Regression with Plotly

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
    (=+ (scatter)
        (linear))
    (target :plotly))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (:=color (first (:=layers %))) :species)
                       (= (:=target %) :plotly))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Three scatter traces (one per species) with ggplot2 colors
;; 2. Three regression lines (computed per-group on JVM)
;; 3. Matching colors for scatter points and regression lines
;; 4. Interactive legend - click to show/hide species
;; 5. Demonstrates full composability with color aesthetics

;; **Simple Histogram with Plotly**:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
    (histogram)
    (target :plotly)
    (size 500 400))

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Histogram computed on JVM using Sturges' rule
;; 2. Pre-computed bins sent to Plotly as bar trace
;; 3. White bar borders (ggplot2 theme)
;; 4. Hover shows bin range and count

;; **Faceted Histogram with Custom Bins (Plotly)**:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
    (histogram {:bins 12})
    (facet {:col :species})
    (target :plotly)
    (size 900 350))

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Per-species histograms (computed on JVM)
;; 2. Faceted layout (3 columns)
;; 3. Shared y-axis for easy comparison
;; 4. Custom bin count (12 bins)
;; 5. Full interactivity with hover tooltips

;; ### 🧪 Example 24: Faceted Scatter with Plotly

(plot
 (-> penguins
     (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
     (scatter)
     (facet {:col :species})
     (target :plotly)
     (size 800 400)))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :data)
                       (contains? % :layout)
                       (sequential? (:data %))
                       (> (count (:data %)) 0))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Data split by species (3 facets)
;; 2. Each facet rendered in separate subplot
;; 3. Shared axes for easy comparison
;; 4. Species names as column headers
;; 5. Independent zoom/pan for each subplot

;; ### 🧪 Example 26: Custom Domains with Plotly

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (scale :x {:domain [30 65]})
    (scale :y {:domain [10 25]})
    (target :plotly))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :=layers)
                       (= (get-in % [:=scale-x :domain]) [30 65])
                       (= (:=target %) :plotly))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Custom domain constraints respected
;; 2. Zoom/pan constrained to specified ranges
;; 3. Same composition semantics across all targets

;; ## 🧪 Compositional Size Specification

;; Width and height can be specified compositionally using the `size` constructor,
;; just like `target`. This enables full threading and keeps plot dimensions as
;; part of the layer specification.

;; **Using the `size` constructor**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (facet {:row :island :col :sex})
    (target :vl)
    (size 800 600))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (= (:=width %) 800)
                       (= (:=height %) 600)
                       (= (:=target %) :vl))])

;; **Full threading with `plot`**:
;; The `plot` function also supports threading, so you can optionally call it
;; explicitly at the end of your pipeline (though auto-display usually handles this):
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
    (scatter {:alpha 0.7})
    (target :plotly)
    (size 1000 500)
    (plot))

(kind/test-last [#(map? (meta %))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. `size` adds `:=width` and `:=height` to the plot spec (plot-level properties)
;; 2. `plot-impl` methods check spec first, then opts, then defaults
;; 3. Priority: `:=width` > `:width opts` > `default-plot-width`
;; 4. Fully compositional - size is part of the plot spec, not external config

;; **Backwards compatibility**:
;; The old pattern still works - `plot` with opts map:
(plot
 (-> penguins
     (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
     (scatter)
     (target :vl))
 {:width 800 :height 600})

(kind/test-last [#(map? (meta %))])

;; Both approaches work. The `size` constructor enables full threading and
;; treats dimensions as compositional layer properties.

;; # Validation Examples
;;
;; The API validates plot specs and layers automatically, so you typically don't
;; need to call validation functions directly. This section shows how validation
;; works and provides examples for debugging when something goes wrong. These
;; are advanced examples - feel free to skip if you just want to create plots.
;;
;; The Malli schemas enable validation at two points:
;; - Construction time
;; - Draw time

;; ## 🧪 Example 1: Valid Layer

;; A properly constructed layer passes validation silently
(validate Layer
          {:=data {:x [1 2 3] :y [4 5 6]}
           :=x :x
           :=y :y
           :=plottype :scatter
           :=alpha 0.7})

;; ## 🧪 Example 2: Invalid Alpha (Out of Range)

;; Alpha must be between 0.0 and 1.0
(validate Layer
          {:=data {:x [1 2 3]}
           :=plottype :scatter
           :=alpha 1.5})

;; ## 🧪 Example 3: Invalid Plot Type

;; Plot type must be one of the defined enums
(validate Layer
          {:=data {:x [1 2 3]}
           :=plottype :invalid-type})

;; ## 🧪 Example 4: Missing Required Aesthetics

;; Scatter plots require both x and y
(validate-layer
 {:=data {:x [1 2 3] :y [4 5 6]}
  :=x :x
  ;; Missing :=y!
  :=plottype :scatter})

;; ## 🧪 Example 5: Missing Column in Dataset

;; Column references must exist in the data
(validate-layer
 {:=data {:x [1 2 3]}
  :=x :x
  :=y :y ;; y column doesn't exist!
  :=plottype :scatter})

;; ## 🧪 Example 6: Programmatic Validation

;; Check validity without throwing
(valid? Layer {:=data {:x [1 2 3]} :=plottype :scatter})

(valid? Layer {:=plottype :invalid})

;; Get detailed error information
(validate Layer {:=plottype :invalid :=alpha 2.0})

;; # Design Discussions
;;
;; This section dives deeper into specific design decisions and their rationale.
;; If you're curious about why certain implementation choices were made, or want
;; to understand the tradeoffs considered, read on. Otherwise, feel free to skip
;; to the [Conclusion](#conclusion).

;; ## 📖 Map-Based IR: Separating Layers from Plot Configuration
;;
;; ### The Design Choice
;;
;; The internal representation uses a map structure with explicit separation:
;;
;; ```clojure
;; {:=layers [{:=data penguins 
;;             :=x :bill-length-mm 
;;             :=y :bill-depth-mm 
;;             :=plottype :scatter}]
;;  :=target :vl
;;  :=width 800
;;  :=height 600}
;; ```
;;
;; ### Why This Structure?
;;
;; **Clean separation of concerns:**
;; - **Layer properties** (`:=data`, `:=x`, `:=y`, `:=plottype`) describe what to visualize
;; - **Plot properties** (`:=target`, `:=width`, `:=height`, scales) describe how to render
;;
;; **Benefits:**
;; 1. **Inspectable** - `kind/pprint` shows clear structure
;; 2. **No duplication** - Plot config appears once, not in every layer
;; 3. **Composable** - `=*` and `=+` can merge both levels correctly
;; 4. **Extensible** - Easy to add new plot-level properties (themes, titles, etc.)
;;
;; ### How Operators Handle It
;;
;; **`=*` (merge):**
;; - Performs cross-product on `:=layers` vectors
;; - Merges plot-level properties (right side wins)
;;
;; **`=+` (overlay):**
;; - Concatenates `:=layers` vectors
;; - Merges plot-level properties (right side wins)
;;
;; **Constructors:**
;; - Layer constructors (`data`, `mapping`, `scatter`) return `{:=layers [...]}`
;; - Plot constructors (`target`, `size`, `scale`) return `{:=property value}`
;; - Both compose naturally via `=*`
;;
;; This design balances compositional elegance with practical clarity.

;; ## 📖 Auto-display vs Explicit Rendering

;; The current design supports two rendering modes:
;; 1. Auto-display: `(=* ...)` returns an object that automatically renders in notebooks
;; 2. Explicit rendering: `(plot layers)` explicitly triggers rendering

;; **The Tension:**

;; **Benefits of auto-display:**
;; - Notebook-friendly: compositions render immediately at the REPL
;; - Convenience: see results without extra ceremony
;; - Matches the algebraic metaphor: expressions evaluate to visualizations

;; **Costs of auto-display:**
;; - Two ways to do the same thing can be confusing
;; - The display wrapper is invisible but affects behavior
;; - Debugging difficulty: In Clay, errors during rendering (not evaluation) can be
;;   harder to track because the `plot` call happens during the display phase rather
;;   than during code evaluation
;; - Less control: What if you want to manipulate layers without triggering display?

;; **When to use which:**
;; - `(=* ...)` - Quick exploration, simple plots, notebook workflows
;; - `(plot (=* ...))` - When you need rendering options, explicit control, or 
;;   easier debugging (errors thrown at the point of the `plot` call)

;; This remains an open design question. The tradeoff between convenience and
;; debuggability may warrant reconsidering the auto-display default.

;; ### 📖 Multimethod Cartesian Expansion

;; The rendering system uses multimethod dispatch on `[target plottype]`:
;; ```clojure
;; (defmulti render-layer
;;   (fn [target layer transform-result alpha]
;;     [target (or (:=transformation layer) (:=plottype layer))]))
;; ```

;; With 3 targets (:geom, :vl, :plotly) and growing plottypes (:scatter, :line,
;; :histogram, :linear...), this creates a cartesian product of methods.

;; **The Tension:**

;; **Benefits of cartesian dispatch:**
;; - Full control per combination - optimize each target/plottype pair
;; - Simple dispatch logic - just a vector
;; - Clear separation of concerns

;; **Costs of cartesian dispatch:**
;; - Method explosion: N targets × M plottypes = N×M methods
;; - Code repetition: Similar logic across targets (e.g., all targets render scatter similarly)
;; - Maintenance burden: Adding a new plottype requires implementing it for all targets
;; - Scalability concern: Currently ~10 methods, could reach 50+ as plottypes grow
;;   (box, violin, density, contour, area, ribbon, etc.)

;; **Alternatives to consider:**
;; 1. Two-level dispatch: Dispatch on target first, then on plottype within target-specific methods
;; 2. Shared abstractions: Default method that delegates to target-specific renderers
;; 3. Hierarchical dispatch: Use Clojure's derive/isa? to share implementations across targets
;; 4. Spec-based rendering: Translate to intermediate spec format, each target consumes specs

;; This design choice affects the library's extensibility and maintainability as
;; the number of supported plot types and rendering targets grows.

;; ### 📖 Key Naming Convention

;; Every layer key uses the `:=` prefix:
;; ```clojure
;; {:=data penguins
;;  :=x :bill-length-mm
;;  :=y :bill-depth-mm
;;  :=color :species
;;  :=plottype :scatter}
;; ```

;; **The Problem:**

;; The `:=` namespace prefix is verbose and creates visual noise:
;; - `:=` appears constantly throughout code
;; - More typing required
;; - Heavier than necessary for the protection it provides

;; **Decision:** Switch to `:=` prefix convention.

;; Use convention keywords with `=` prefix: `:=color`, `:=x`, `:=data`
;; ```clojure
;; {:=data penguins
;;  :=x :bill-length-mm
;;  :=y :bill-depth-mm
;;  :=color :species
;;  :=plottype :scatter}
;; ```

;; **Benefits:**
;; - Distinctive: prevents collision with data column names (`:=color` vs `:color`)
;; - Consistent with other Tableplot APIs
;; - Lightweight: less visual noise than `:=`
;; - Clear distinction between layer spec and data
;; - Less typing required

;; ### 📖 Validation Timing

;; The current design has two validation flags:
;; - `*validate-on-construction*` (default: false) - validate when calling `scatter`, `linear`, etc.
;; - `*validate-on-draw*` (default: true) - validate when calling `plot`

;; **The Problem:**

;; The dual flag system is confusing and unnecessary. Having two separate controls creates
;; complexity without clear benefit.

;; **Current behavior (validate-on-draw):**
;; - Flexible composition - build invalid intermediate states, validate at the end
;; - Performance - avoid validating the same layer multiple times
;; - BUT: Errors discovered late, potentially confusing stacktraces
;; - BUT: Error points to `plot`, not the construction site where the mistake was made

;; **Better approach (validate-on-construction, true by default):**
;; - Fail fast - errors caught immediately at the construction site
;; - Better error context - stacktrace shows exactly where the bad layer was created
;; - Simpler mental model - one validation flag, early validation by default
;; - Still allow disabling for performance-critical scenarios if needed

;; **Decision:** Remove dual flags, use single `*validate*` flag (default: true).
;; Validate eagerly at construction time for better developer experience.

;; ### 📖 Type Inference Strategy

;; The current design attempts to infer data types from plain Clojure data structures:
;; ```clojure
;; (defn- infer-from-values [values]
;;   (cond
;;     (every? number? values) :numerical
;;     (every? string? values) :categorical
;;     (every? keyword? values) :categorical
;;     :else :categorical))
;; ```

;; **The Problem:**

;; Maintaining separate type inference logic creates complexity and potential bugs:
;; - Can guess wrong: `[1 2 3]` might be categories, not numerical
;; - Silent failures: wrong inference produces incorrect visualizations without warning
;; - Code duplication: reimplementing what tablecloth already does well
;; - Two code paths: dataset vs plain data handling

;; **Decision:** Delegate to the dataset library.

;; If users want type control, they should use datasets (tablecloth). If they provide
;; plain data structures `{:x [1 2 3]}`, the library will convert them internally to
;; datasets via `ensure-dataset`, and we'll rely on tablecloth's type inference logic.

;; This approach:
;; - Eliminates duplicate type inference code
;; - Leverages existing, well-tested tablecloth logic
;; - Provides escape hatch: users who need type control can construct typed datasets
;; - Simplifies the codebase

;; ### 📖 Faceting Implementation Complexity

;; The current faceting implementation uses multiple helper functions with manual
;; grid organization:
;; - `split-by-facets` - splits layers by facet values
;; - `has-faceting?` - checks if any layer has facets
;; - `organize-by-facets` - creates the grid structure

;; **The Tension:**

;; The faceting code feels heavier and more imperative than the rest of the algebra:
;; ```clojure
;; (defn- organize-by-facets [layers-vec]
;;   ;; Complex nested logic to create facet grid
;;   ...)
;; ```

;; **Current approach (manual grid organization):**
;; - Full control over layout and rendering
;; - Can optimize for specific cases
;; - BUT: Complex code with nested loops
;; - BUT: Hard to extend (e.g., free scales, different facet layouts)
;; - BUT: Doesn't match the compositional spirit of `=*` and `=+`

;; **Question:** Is there a more compositional approach?
;; - Could transducers simplify the faceting operations?
;; - Can faceting be expressed more declaratively?
;; - Should faceting be part of the algebra rather than a special case?

;; The challenge: faceting is inherently about spatial layout (a grid), which is
;; different from the layer composition that `=*` and `=+` handle. Perhaps some
;; imperative complexity is unavoidable, or perhaps a different abstraction could
;; make it feel more algebraic.

;; ### 📖 Error Message Enhancement

;; The current validation system produces structured error messages via Malli:
;; ```clojure
;; (validate Layer {:=plottype :invalid})
;; ;; Returns detailed Malli error with path and humanized explanation
;; ```

;; **Current state (Malli errors):**
;; - Structured error data via `ex-data` - machine-readable for tooling
;; - Consistent format across all validation
;; - BUT: Generic messages like "should be one of :scatter, :point, :line..."
;; - BUT: May not provide context-specific guidance for common mistakes

;; **Opportunity for enhancement:**
;; The current Malli errors are functional but could be significantly improved:
;; ```clojure
;; ;; Current:
;; "Invalid value for :=plottype. Should be one of :scatter, :point, :line"
;;
;; ;; Enhanced:
;; "Unknown plot type :scater. Did you mean :scatter? 
;; Available: :scatter, :point, :line, :histogram
;; See: (doc scatter) or https://..."
;; ```

;; **Enhancements to consider:**
;; 1. Did-you-mean suggestions using string distance (typo detection)
;; 2. Show valid examples when validation fails
;; 3. Context-specific guidance for common errors
;; 4. Links to relevant documentation
;; 5. Better error messages for missing required aesthetics (e.g., "scatter requires both :x and :y")

;; **Decision:** Worth pursuing, but not in this initial design phase.
;; Keep current Malli errors for now, enhance in future iteration.

;; # Conclusion

;; ## 📖 What We've Explored
;;
;; This notebook demonstrates a composable graphics API with **minimal delegation**:
;;
;; **Core Design**:
;; - Layers as flat maps with `:=...` distinctive keys
;; - Composition using `*` (merge) and `+` (overlay)
;; - Standard library operations work natively
;; - Backend-agnostic IR
;;
;; **Delegation Strategy**:
;; 1. ✅ **We compute**: Statistical transforms, domains (when needed), types (from Tablecloth)
;; 2. ❌ **We delegate**: Axis rendering, ranges, ticks, "nice numbers", layout
;;
;; **Key Wins**:
;; - Type information from Tablecloth (free!)
;; - Domain computation only for statistical transforms
;; - Leverage rendering target polish for rendering
;; - Simple, focused implementation

;; ## 📖 Where We Are

;; So that's the exploration. We set out to see if AlgebraOfGraphics.jl's compositional
;; approach could work in Clojure using plain maps and standard operations. The flat
;; structure with distinctive `:=` keys turned out pretty well—standard `merge` just works,
;; everything stays inspectable, and the threading macros feel natural. Getting type
;; information from Tablecloth for free was a nice bonus that eliminated a lot of
;; complexity.

;; The minimal delegation strategy (we compute transforms, rendering targets handle
;; layout) seems about right. We need domains before we can bin histograms anyway,
;; so might as well compute them. Everything else—axis formatting, tick placement,
;; "nice numbers"—the existing libraries already do better than we would.

;; There are rough edges. The threading-macro polymorphism (detecting whether the first
;; arg is layers or data) adds some complexity. Faceting works but doesn't feel as
;; algebraically elegant as `=*` and `=+`. Error messages could be much better. And we
;; haven't tested with large datasets yet. But nothing here feels like a fundamental
;; blocker—more like things to improve as we learn from usage.

;; ## 📖 What's Missing

;; This is a prototype, not a complete plotting library. We've got scatter, line,
;; histogram, linear regression, and faceting working across three rendering targets.
;; That's enough to explore the design, but Tableplot's existing APIs handle many more
;; plot types, aesthetics, transforms, and coordinate systems. Those aren't abandoned,
;; just deferred until we know if this approach is worth pursuing.

;; ## 📖 What Comes Next

;; Honestly, we're not sure yet. This could become a new namespace in Tableplot,
;; or it could just inform improvements to the existing APIs, or it could stay as
;; a design study. The goal was to explore whether a compositional approach could
;; work with plain Clojure data structures—and it seems like it can. What we do
;; with that depends on what we hear from people who try it.

;; If you've read this far and have thoughts—especially if you use Tableplot or build
;; visualizations regularly—we'd be interested to hear them. Try the code, see what
;; feels right or awkward, share what's missing for your use cases. This is happening
;; in the [Real-World Data dev group](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/real-world-data/)
;; context, so feedback actually shapes what gets built.

;; Thanks to the AlgebraOfGraphics.jl folks for the inspiration, to Tableplot users
;; for the feedback that motivated this exploration, and to the Real-World Data group
;; for the space to try new ideas.

;; ---
;;
;; **What comes next?** That depends on what we learn from sharing this work. For now,
;; this is a design exploration—a snapshot of our process, shared in the spirit of
;; collaborative development.
;;
;; *Feedback welcome. Let's see where this goes together.*
