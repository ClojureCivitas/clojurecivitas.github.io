<p>Usually, when we wish to create Clojure Civitas posts, we enjoy the fact that Civitas runs our notebooks in the GitHub Actions as it renders the website.</p>
<p>While this is the default behavior, sometimes, we cannot expect our notebooks to be run in GitHub Actions. For example, they may depend on a local file or service.</p>
<p>This notebook, for example, assumes that you have a local secrets file, and it will not work without it!</p>

  <link>https://clojurecivitas.github.io/conferences/scinoj_light_1/notes/hallway_track.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The <a href="https://scicloj.github.io/scinoj-light-1">SciNoj Light #1</a> Conference brought together Clojure enthusiasts, data scientists, and researchers for an engaging exploration of data analysis stories. The event fostered a collaborative, informal atmosphere where participants exchanged ideas across disciplines from cognitive psychology to urban planning.</p>
<p>If you missed it, you can view the talks on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb_VRZPxjMAAaoAPnk8ClWET3baRV1Whv">conference sessions playlist</a>. The <a href="https://scicloj.github.io/scinoj-light-1/speakers.html">conference website</a> has detailed information about the talks and speakers. Links to the notebook code presented are on the <a href="https://scicloj.github.io/scinoj-light-1/sessions">sessions page</a>, and available as data in the <a href="https://github.com/scicloj/scinoj-light-1/blob/main/info.edn">info.edn file</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/3HZ5rngHzWM">concluding talk on lane reductions</a> stood out as my favorite because it blended data-driven insights with relatable, human-interest storytelling. As a cyclist, I immediately connected with how lane reductions and protected bike lanes are impactful to my safety. The talk’s compelling visuals, grounded in real case studies, made the story very tangible. Heather’s personal perspective as a car-free parent added emotional weight. She illustrated how community advocacy and smart urban design saves lives, and makes more livable spaces. The mix of passion, rigor, and optimism left me inspired; data analysis can drive tangible, life-improving change.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence emerged as a recurring theme, with several talks exploring hybrid approaches to enhance reliability. One discussion centered on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where combining large language models with Clojure’s logic programming capabilities could improve accuracy in structured domains like government Q&amp;A. Another session delved into probabilistic programming with Inferme, illustrating Bayesian methods for modeling uncertainty. These technical deep dives were balanced by ethical considerations and reflections on technology’s societal implications.</p>
<p>Scientific applications showcased Clojure’s versatility. One talk explored simulating fluid dynamics. Another focused on forecasting tropical cyclone paths using physics-informed machine learning. Cognitive science experiments were also featured, using collaborative games and puzzles to study human planning behavior, and brain wave monitors. The conference also highlighted social impact work, such as data-driven advocacy for safer street designs, proving that technical tools can drive urban change.</p>
<p>What stood out to me was how effectively the SciCloj community uses Clojure notebooks for collaborative work. Presenters shared their research through executable notebooks that cleanly combined code, visualizations and explanations. It’s a practical pattern broadly applicable for sharing ideas and knowledge.</p>
<p>Throughout the event, a sense of optimism prevailed about Clojure’s untapped potential. While acknowledging gaps in ML tooling compared to Python, speakers demonstrated that Clojure’s functional rigor and JVM scalability make it a good fit for data science. Attendee discussions envisioned collaborating further on logic-guided AI and semantic web ontologies. There was a recurring theme of bridging the gap between academic theory and real-world engineering. SciNoj Light ultimately painted a picture of Clojure not just as a language, but as a catalyst for interdisciplinary innovation.</p>

<section id="an-intro-to-the-noj-toolkit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-intro-to-the-noj-toolkit">1.2: An intro to the Noj toolkit</h3>
<p>Noj is a Clojure-based data science toolkit integrating libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Designed for functional, efficient data processing with compatibility across libraries (e.g., Tablecloth, FastMath, Metamorph). Inspired by tools like R’s dplyr/ggplot and Python’s pandas/Plotly, but with a Clojure-centric approach. Tablecloth for tabular data manipulation (similar to pandas/dplyr). TablePlot grammar-of-graphics-inspired visualization (like ggplot). FastMath stats and statistical modeling (logistic regression and more). Metamorph for machine learning workflows. Worked example of predicting success in Kickstarter projects. Data loading/cleaning, exploratory analysis (grouping, aggregation, bar plots), predictive modeling, evaluation (train/test split, accuracy checks). Functional &amp; Immutable, Noj leverages Clojure’s strengths. Efficient columnar storage with zero-copy operations.</p>

<section id="probability-and-statistics---daniel-slutsky" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="probability-and-statistics---daniel-slutsky">1.3: Probability and statistics - Daniel Slutsky</h3>
<p>Generating pseudo-random numbers using seeds for reproducibility in research. Simulating dice rolls to explore distributions. Used histograms and scatter plots to visualize distributions. Computed mean, standard deviation and z-scores for comparison. Bayesian inference for probabilistic models with parameters. Conditioned models on observed data to infer posterior distributions. Highlighted constraints and efficient sampling algorithms. Avoid lazy sequences for large simulations; consider dtype-next or transducers. Visualization matters, histograms and scatter plots reveal patterns. Probabilistic programming models uncertainty and updates beliefs with data. Balanced foundational stats with advanced topics, emphasizing Clojure’s tools for data science.</p>

<section id="customer-churn-analysis-llms-logic-programming---siavash-mohammady" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="customer-churn-analysis-llms-logic-programming---siavash-mohammady">1.4: Customer churn analysis, LLMs &amp; logic programming - Siavash Mohammady</h3>
<p>Customers leaving significantly impacts revenue. Exploring factors like course format, teacher experience, and registration patterns. High churn in early months, newer teachers correlated with higher churn. User prompt → NLP entity recognition → LLM generates high-level DSL → Clara rule engine translates to low-level DSL → Execution. Mentorship for new teachers can reduce churn. Pairing LLMs abstract reasoning with logic engines concrete execution optimizes complex data tasks. A forward-looking talk blending data science, AI, and Clojure, emphasizing doing less.</p>
</section>
<section id="linear-foundations-nonlinear-frontiers---jelena-losic" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linear-foundations-nonlinear-frontiers---jelena-losic">1.5: Linear Foundations &amp; Nonlinear Frontiers - Jelena Losic</h3>
<p>Linear systems rely on superposition, the whole is the sum of parts. Vector spaces, linear regression, Fourier analysis. Real-world systems are often nonlinear. Linear methods fail when data lies on curved manifolds or exhibits complex interactions. Techniques like t-SNE, UMAP, and autoencoders handle nonlinearity by preserving structures or learning manifold geometry. Nonlinear systems can be deterministic yet unpredictable. Nonlinear methods unlock richer patterns but sacrifice interpretability and require more data. Dimensionality reduction illustrates the trade-off between simplicity and accuracy. Embeddings leverage linear algebra but rely on nonlinear transformations for deeper semantics.</p>
</section>
<section id="raggedy-anns-big-adventure---paula-gearon" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="raggedy-anns-big-adventure---paula-gearon">1.6: RAGgedy Ann’s Big Adventure - Paula Gearon</h3>
<p>Vectors represent concepts in multidimensional space. Embeddings convert text into vectors, capturing meaning. Similarity between vectors is measurable. Neural networks process inputs through weighted connections and activation functions. Transformers contextualize words in sentences. Combining LLMs with vector databases to reduce hallucinations. Augmenting queries with retrieved context. LLMs are built from modular math operations. Vector databases enable semantic search. RAG improves accuracy by grounding LLM outputs in verified data.</p>
</section>
<section id="parliamentary-questions---rag-evaluation---eoin-carney" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parliamentary-questions---rag-evaluation---eoin-carney">1.7: Parliamentary Questions - RAG Evaluation - Eoin Carney</h3>
<p>Can RAG effectively answer parliamentary style questions using Irish government data? 10k publicly available Irish parliamentary questions and answers. Compared sentence-based chunking with full document retrieval. Tested multiple LLMs for generation and evaluation. Retrieval Matters More Than Prompting. Smaller, precise chunks of 3–5 sentences improved precision over full document retrieval. Direct answer retrieval outperformed matching questions to answers. Deterministic metrics like word overlap failed to capture nuance. LLM as judge worked better for correctness. Clay notebook visualization helped explore vector embeddings interactively. Government answers should be plain and factual. LLMs are oddly well-suited for that.</p>
</section>

<p>Imagine being able to experiment with Clojure without needing to install tooling, set up editors, or even know about deps.edn Sounds like a dream, right? Well, dream no more—meet <a href="https://scicloj.github.io/noj/">Noj’s</a> new Code Reload Executable!</p>

<p>We can skip the Clojure tooling and editor setup, but we do need to install the recommended Adoptive Java. Now we download the latest Noj jar from the Scicloj Noj GitHub releases page. Let’s check the jar is in the Downloads directory, and that we have java installed by executing <code>java -version</code>.</p>
<p>Launch Noj using <code>java -jar</code> and the path to the jar file. Pro tip, if you press tab while typing a path, it will autocomplete. Noj is running, it created a directory called notebooks, and it recommends we create a Clojure file there.</p>
<p>I’ll create my file with Notepad, being careful to create a .clj file rather than a text file. When I saved that file, a browser window opened. Let’s put them side by side. Every time I save the file, the notebook updates.</p>
<p>If I’m interested in one particular top-level form, I can narrow the output by adding ,, anywhere in the form. And removing it renders the full notebook. And check this out—comments are rendered as Markdown. How cool is that? What an easy way to get coding!</p>
<p>Noj isn’t just a notebook—it’s a fully featured data science environment. It includes interesting datasets that can be queried and the results shown as tables or even better as charts.</p>
<p>Noj makes experimenting with Clojure easier than ever. No setup headaches, no complicated tooling—just pure coding joy.</p>
<p>Until next time, Keep on coding</p>
